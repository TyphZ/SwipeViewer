# SwipeViever

Finds images in a folder and turn them into a desktop/mobile slideshow with swipe gestures.

## Features

* No setup required ! Just download the [zip](https://github.com/noahlaux/SwipeViewer/zipball/master) and add images to the ```img``` folder, and you're flying
* Runs smooooooth on your desktop and mobile devices (looks awesome on iPads!)
* Supports swipe gestures, keyboard and mouse input
* All JavaScript, so no server needed

## Quick start

Add numbered image files to the ```img``` folder like ```01.jpg```, ```02.jpg``` etc. By default swipeviewer supports jpg extension, but you can easily change the format in the js file.

Images defaults to be 100% of windows width, so if you want to make a quick iPad slide show, make a couple of 1024x768px images.

## Supported gestures

You can navigate the slideshow with the following keys:

* Swipe left and right on your mobile device
* Touch or click on the left/right edges of the screen
* use ```<-``` and ```->``` arrow keys on your keyboard
* ```home``` button goes to first slide and ```end``` button goes to last slide
* ```spacebar``` also takes you to the next slide
